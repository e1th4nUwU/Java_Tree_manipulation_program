![Tree Image](img/treeImg.png)
This Java program allows you to manipulate different types of trees and perform various operations on them.

## Binary Tree Menu 🌳

1. **Exit:** Exit the program. ❌
2. **Reset Tree:** Clear the binary tree. 🔄
3. **Add Data:** Add a node to the binary tree. ➕
4. **Delete Node:** Delete a node from the binary tree. 🗑️
5. **Print Tree (BFS):** Print the binary tree using Breadth-First Search traversal. 🌐
6. **Preorder:** Print the binary tree using Preorder traversal. 🌳🔼
7. **Inorder:** Print the binary tree using Inorder traversal. 🌳✅
8. **Postorder:** Print the binary tree using Postorder traversal. 🌳🔽
9. **View Nodes with Children:** Display the nodes of the binary tree along with their children. 👥

## Binary Search Tree Menu 🔍🌳

1. **Exit:** Exit the program. ❌
2. **Reset Tree:** Clear the binary search tree. 🔄
3. **Add Data:** Add a node to the binary search tree. ➕
4. **Delete Node:** Delete a node from the binary search tree. 🗑️
5. **Search:** Search for specific data in the binary search tree. 🔍
6. **Print Tree (BFS):** Print the binary search tree using Breadth-First Search traversal. 🌐

## B-Tree Menu 🅱️🌳

1. **Exit:** Exit the program. ❌
2. **Reset Tree:** Clear the B-Tree. 🔄
3. **Add Data:** Add data to the B-Tree. ➕
4. **Search Data:** Search for specific data in the B-Tree. 🔍
5. **Print Tree:** Print the B-Tree. 🌳🌐

## Compiling the Code 🛠️

To compile the code, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. ☕
2. Save the code in a file named `Main.java`.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing `Main.java`.
4. Run the following command to compile the code:

   ```shell
   javac Main.java

5. If there are no syntax errors, the code will be compiled, and a Main.class file will be generated.

## Running the program▶️
To run the program, use the following command:

```shell
java Main
```

## Running the Program from a JAR File 📦
Alternatively, if you have a JAR file named Arboles.jar, you can run the program using the following command:

```shell
java -jar Arboles.jar
```
That's it! You can now compile and run the Java program to manipulate different types of trees and perform various operations on them. Enjoy! 😄🌳
